#Non-Foya Archive — Business Analytics Dashboard

An interactive Streamlit dashboard built to support data-driven decision-making for Non-Foya Archive, an independent, founder-led clothing brand.

The dashboard integrates sales, inventory, product drop, customer, and Instagram data to help non-technical stakeholders answer questions around:

Which products should be restocked vs discontinued

How different drops perform over time

Where inventory is getting stuck (dead stock)

How Instagram engagement aligns with sales

Whether the brand is building repeat customers

This project is designed as a realistic analytics product, not a toy dataset or one-off analysis.
