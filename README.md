# Non-Foya Archive — Business Analytics Dashboard

An interactive Streamlit dashboard built to support data-driven decision-making for Non-Foya Archive, an independent, founder-led clothing brand.

The dashboard integrates sales, inventory, product drop, customer, and Instagram data to help non-technical stakeholders answer questions around:

- Which products should be restocked vs discontinued

- How different drops perform over time

- Where inventory is getting stuck (dead stock)

- How Instagram engagement aligns with sales

- Whether the brand is building repeat customers

This project is designed as a realistic analytics product, not a toy dataset or one-off analysis.

## Project Motivation

Independent clothing brands operate with limited capital and high uncertainty. Decisions about drop sizing, pricing, restocking, and marketing are often made based on intuition rather than data.

This dashboard provides a lightweight analytics layer that allows founders and operators to:

- Understand what is working and what is not

- Reduce inventory risk

- Make more confident operational and marketing decisions
